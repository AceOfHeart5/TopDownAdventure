This is a game maker project. Although Game Maker is intuitive, I feel that the actual files are hard to understand when not viewed in game maker. Here's a small explanation of how things work:

99% of the code I've written is in the objects and scripts folders. For every object/script, there's a folder with gml files and a yy file. The gml files are what I've written, the yy is auto-generated by game maker. All objects in game maker are event driven. For example, the create event is called when an instance of the object is created. If you're interested in diving deeper, look at Create_0.gml and Step_0.gml in the o_master object, then Create_0.gml and Other_10.gml in the o_gameworld object. 

Step events are called every frame in game maker (the Step_0.gml file). User events (Other_10.gml -  Other_14.gml) are executed when the script "user_event(number)" is called. In this project, you'll see "user_event(EVENT_LOGIC)" called frequently. Only the master object has a step event. Everything else has its logic in user events. This allows me to have more control over when things execute.
