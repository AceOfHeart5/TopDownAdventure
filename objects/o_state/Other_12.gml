/// @description Remain

/*
This event will set remain to true if the actor cannot exit this state. Remember that
just because an actor "can" exit the state doesn't mean they will. For example, in our other 
project, the remain script for the idle state would not return true if any buttons were 
being pressed. But if there was no state to connect to, then the idle state was not exited.
