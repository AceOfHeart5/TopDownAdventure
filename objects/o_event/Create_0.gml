/*
We aren't really going to create an event "system" for this game. I think this is something
that could be extremely powerful if given more thought, but I'm not going to flesh it out
that hard for this project. 

What we need this for in this game, is our menus. They are becoming far too spaghetti for
our tastes, and we need a non-spaghetti way for various menus to tell other menus what to
do. All our events are going to do are exist, get read, and get deleted. They may contain
some variables.
